I almost put it on par with Pillars of the Earth in terms of the sheer detail in the exploration of each character and their inner worlds, thoughts and emotions. Firstly, I like it for its size - I am a sucker for long stories. I remember when I was reaching the end of the book I felt as though all the revelations seemed a but rushed because I like a long stew. Secondly, I like it for rekindling my love for fantasy and world building again. Sanderson does an absolutely incredible job at describing parts of Roshar and the jambalaya of cultures of its inhabitants. Yes, there were some faults - some redundant descriptions and very bad puns from Shallan, and at times simplistic prose (when one of the things I love about reading are how authors play around with language) - but I still loved it despite those.
